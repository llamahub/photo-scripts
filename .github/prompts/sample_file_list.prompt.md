I want some analysis of the folder structure and file distribution in my photo library: /mnt/photo_drive/santee-image

I also want to extract copies of a sample of 100 to 250 files from this library for testing purposes and mimicking the folder structure.

How many intances are there of each level of nesting of folders in this library? For example:
- 0 levels (files directly in /mnt/photo_drive/santee-images)
- 1 level (files in folders directly in /mnt/photo_drive/santee-images)
- 2 levels (files in subfolders of folders in /mnt/photo_drive/santee-images)

Where does the folder structure deviate from this pattern?
<decade>/
  <year>/
    <month>/
      <day>/
        <event>/
          <files>

What is the range of min# to max# of files at each level of nesting? For example: 
- 0 levels: min 5, max 50
- 1 level: min 10, max 100
- 2 levels: min 20, max 200 

Please provide a summary of the folder structure analysis and a list of the sampled files with their paths, maintaining the original folder hierarchy as much as possible.
