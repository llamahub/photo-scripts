For the entire project I want my documentation (.md files) to be organized in a way that is easy to navigate and understand.

I want to create a doc folder inside the root of the monorepo, in the COMMON project folder and in other subprojects as needed.

At the same level as the doc folder I want a README.md file that provides an overview of the documentation structure and links to the main sections.
